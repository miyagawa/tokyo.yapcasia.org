	 Reading some Paul Graham notes, I found an interesting comment regarding workspace  : An office environment is supposed to be something that helps you work, not something you work despite.

My home workspace is, at the moment, very messy due to a large workload and various non-related activities. I'm pretty sure (at least for me) that the very near objects (less than 1 meter)  on a desk are affecting the work done or your general ability to focus on a specific work (especially programming). I really don't know why, you know we are a such complex piece of software... we are not all equal in the ability to concentrate.

	UNIX philosophy and RSS
	 I just tested Plagger a Perl module working as Pluggable RSS/Atom Aggregator with a bunch of extensions/modules.

	Conference business
	 A very good blog entry about conference business, very informative and the comments are quite good. The conference business world has to change its habits of the over-priced conference, non-interactive session and commercial only events. This is really true for a large number of computer-related conferences.

I've build Balham Blogs. It's a site that aggregates RSS feeds that have some connection with Balham. I was going to use the Planet software, but last week someone mentioned Plagger to me and as it's a Perl toolkit I used that instead.

Plagger is still under heavy development and the documentation leaves a little to be desired. I had to resort to reading code a few times in order to work out what I needed to do. But in the end it only took a few hours to get the site up and running.

If you run a site that produces an RSS (or Atom, I'm not fussy) feed that has somethi ng to do with Balham, then please let me know and I'll be happy to add it.</summary>
